Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:
Why do we need data structure?
-   Data structure in Java is needed so that storing and organizing data can be done efficiently

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
-   The following can be performed on different Data Structures:
    * Traversing
    * Searching
    * Inserting
    * Deleting
    * Sorting
    * Merging

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
-   Some areas in which data structures are applied extensively are:
    * Compiler Design
    * Operating System
    * Database Management System
    * Statistical Analysis Package
    * Numerical Analysis
    * Graphics
    * Simulation
    * Artifical Intelligence

what is an Array?
-  	An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type
- 	The differences between Array and ArrayList are:
    *	Array is a fixed length data structure; You can not change length of Array once created
    *	ArrayList is a variable length Collection class;
    *   ArrayList re-size itself when gets full depending upon capacity and load factor

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?

what is LinkedList?
-   A LinkedList is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object

How is an Array different from Linked List?

-   The difference in bewteen Array and Linked List is:
    *   In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location.
    *   In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node

what is queue?
- 	Queue represents an ordered list of objects just like a List, but its intended use is slightly different


what is stack?
-   Stack is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle

what is FIFO and LIFO?
-   FIFO and LIFO are:
    * FIFO: First In First Out
    * LIFO: Last In First Out

what is the order of complexity?
-   When you optimize code for speed, if an input requires size of N in the code, it will have O(N) complexity.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-   The best case to search an element from an array is by first element of the list.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
-   The worst case to search an element from an array is by last element of the list.
what is tree in data structure?
-   A tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure,
with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
-   A graph is an object consisting of a vertex set and an edge set
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
- 	The difference between the HashTable and HashMap are:
    * HashTable -  a data structure to retain values of key-value pair
    * HashMap - accepts key value pair

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
-   The major data structures used are as follows:
    * RDBMS: Array
    * Network data model: Graph
    * Hierarchical data model: Trees

How HashMap works in java?
-   HashMap accepts key value pair in java

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
-   All array accesses are checked at run time;
an attempt to use an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the array
causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
-   There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one array into another array in Java.
    *   Manually
    *   Arrays.copyOf()
    *   System.arraycopy()
    *   Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
-   The difference in bewteen Array and Linked List is:
    *   In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location.
    *   In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node

What is DFS and BFS?
-   DFS and BFS are:
    *   DFS: Depth First Search
    *   BFS: Breadth First Search

What is Recursion?
-   Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
-   The difference between Linear and Non-Linear structures are:
    *	Linear data structure - all the data are arranged in sequence manner
    *	Nonlinear data structure - all the data are arranged in random manner



What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big-(O)-notation describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
-   *   QuickSort: Best(O(n log(n)); Average(O(nlog(n));worst(O(N^2)
    *   InsertionSort: Best(O(n));Average(O(n^2));worst(O(n^2))

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
